    TOperatorState represents the various states of an independent DxStation/
    DxOperator object. During a pile-up, multiple DxStation objects will exist.
    These states represent the operational state of each unique station within
    a simulated QSO.

    Each state follows the back and forth transmissions between the user and
    an indiviual DxOperator. Remember that DxStation and DxOperator objects
    are the simulated stations within the MR simulation.

    State           Description
    NORMAL FLOW...
    osNeedPrevEnd   Starting point. This is the initial operator state for a
                    newly created DxStation. The station will wait for the
                    completion of any prior QSO's as indicated by either
                    the user's next CQ call or a 'TU' message.
    osNeedQso       The DxOperator is waiting for their Dx callsign to be sent
                    by user. This state begins after the user has either called
                    CQ or finished the prior QSO by sending a 'TU' message.
                    For RunMode rmSingle, the CQ message is assumed and
                    the DxOperator immediately goes into this state
                    (expecting their callsign to be sent by user).
                    Typical response msg: send DxStation's callsign.
    osNeedNr        DxOperator is waiting for user's exchange.
                    DxOperator has received the user's callsign and is now
                    waiting to receive the user's exchange.
                    Typical response: send DxStation's exchange.
    osNeedEnd       DxStation is waiting for 'TU' from user.
                    User's call and exchange have been received.
                    Typical response msg: send DxStation's exchange.
    osDone          DxOperator has received a 'TU' from the user.
                    This QSO is now considered complete and can be logged.

    SPECIAL CASES (timeouts, call/exchange copy errors, random events)...
    osFailed        This QSO has failed. Reasons for failure include:
                    - DxStation is created and waits for the User to call their
                      callsign. If the user does not call them within a given
                      timeframe, the DxOperator will loose Patience and stop
                      sending their callsign. This is a form of caller ghosting
                      where the DxOperator gives up due to lack of patience
                      (occurs whenever Patience decrements to zero).
                    - user sends a msgNIL, which forces the QSO to fail.
                    - user sends a msgB4, stating that they had a prior QSO.
    osNeedCall      DxStation is expecting their call to be corrected by the
                    user. This state is entered when user sends a partially-
                    correct callsign. This DxOperator will wait for the correct
                    call to be sent before sending its Exchange.
                    The logic also appears to support the fact the user's
                    exchange (NR) has already been copied by this DxStation.
                    Once corrected, we should send 'R <exch>'.
                    Typical response msg: send DxStation's callsign
    osNeedCallNr    DxStation is expecting both their callsign and Exchange
                    to be sent by user.
                    This state is entered when the DxStation receives a
                    partially-correct callsign from the user. In this case,
                    the QSO advances from osNeedQso to osNeedCallNr.
                    Once the correct callsign is received, the next state will
                    be osNeedNr.
                    Typical response msg: DxStation's callsign

{
  The notion of ghosting refers to a DxOperator who has run out of
  Patience and is leaving the QSO because the User has failed to respond.
  This will occur if the User does not respond or continue to interact with
  this DxOperator. A station is considered ghosting whenever Patience = 0.

  When a DxStation is ghosting, it will:
  - leaving the QSO because User did not complete QSO
  - will not send additional transmissions to the user
  - will retain in set of active stations so it can still receive messages
    from the user. Most often, it is waiting for the final 'TU' message.
  - if 'TU' is received, then the station can be added to the log.

  DecPatience is typically called after an evTimeout event.
  The TDxOperator.Patience value is decremented down to zero.
  When this count reaches zero, the DxStation will start "ghosting" and
  stop transmitting. The ghosting station will remain active so it can
  receive final messages from user, logged and deleted from the simulation.

{
  MorePatience is called to add additional patience while remaining in the
  current state. This will happen when a message is received from the user
  without an associated state change. Without adding additional patience,
  the DxStation will timeout and disappear from the user in the middle of
  an ongoing QSO.

  Parameter AValue is an optional Patience value.
  If AValue > 0, Patience is set to this value;
  else if Patience=FULL_PATIENCE, no changes;
  else if RunMode = rmSingle, Patience is set to 4;
  otherwise Patience is incremented by 2 (up to maximum of 4).

  Note: When MorePatience was introduced in May 2024, a bug (Issue #370) was
  introduced causing the DxStation to not send an 'R' after the user corrected
  a callsign. The case involved the user sending a corrected callsign using
  the Enter key while leaving the exchange fields blank (user sends
  '<his incorrect call> ?'. In this case, the DxOperator.MsgReceived function
  would call MorePatience for the '?' and the Patience value was set to 4.
  This caused DxOperator.GetReply() to send the wrong response:
      DxOperator.GetReply(osNeedEnd, Patience=5) --> 'R <HisCall>'
      DxOperator.GetReply(osNeedEnd, Patience=4) --> '<HisCall>'
  To fix this problem, MorePatience will maintain an existing Patience value
  of 5 (FULL_PATIENCE) and not set it to 4. Resolved in October 2024.
}
procedure TDxOperator.MorePatience(AValue: integer);
begin
  if State = osDone then Exit;

  if AValue > 0 then
    Patience := Min(AValue, FULL_PATIENCE)
  else if Patience < FULL_PATIENCE then
    begin
      if RunMode = rmSingle then
        Patience := 4
      else
        Patience := Min(Patience + 2, 4);
    end;
end;


{
  Calling this function will set the new State and compute a new Patience
  value to represent how patient this operator will be while waiting for
  a subsequent transmission from the user.

  SetState will:
    - set the operator State - See TOperatorState.
    - set Patience value - represents operator patience while waiting
      for response from user.
      - For osNeedQso, Patience is set to a random value using a
        Rayleigh distribution within the range of [1, 14] retries,
        with a Mean value of 4.
      - For all other states, Patience is set to 5.

  This function is typically called by TDxOperator.MsgReceived() whenever
  new TStationMessages are being sent to this DxStation/DxOperator by the
  simulation engine.
}
procedure TDxOperator.SetState(AState: TOperatorState);
begin
  State := AState;

  {
    Patience, set below, represents how long a station will stay around to
    complete a QSO with the user. FULL_PATIENCE = 5. Patience is the number of
    TimeOut events to occur before this station will disappear.
    A TimeOut is typically in the range of 3-6 seconds (See GetReplyTimeout).

    When entering the osNeedQso state, the original code was setting a Patience
    value which would cause a station to disappear quickly after its first
    transmission (i.e. sending its callsign). This was caused by the original
    RndRayleigh(4) distribution below having a result in the range [0,2] about
    6% of the time.

    In May 2024, this was changed to '3 + RndRayleigh(3)' to keep the
    station around long enough for the user to respond to a call.
    This fixes the so-called ghosting-problem where stations would disappear
    almost immediately after sending their callsign for the first time.
    See Issue #200 for additional information.

    0 + RndRayleigh(4)   0+([1,14], mean 4); value 0|1|2 occurs 6% (ghosting)

    3 + RndRayleigh(2)   3+([1, 7], mean 2); [4,10], mean 5; value 4 occurs 11%
