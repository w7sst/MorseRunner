PLATFORMS
  - Windows XP/7/8/10/11
  - works on Linux systems under WINE (info TNX F8BQQ).

INSTALLATION
  Open the zip file, extract the folder to your DESKTOP, and run
  MorseRunner.exe within this folder. Do not add these files to
  a previous release folder, or place in a windows program directory
  as this causes errors.

UNINSTALLATION
  - Delete MorseRunner directory.

CONFIGURATION
  First time setup instructions can be found within the program under help.

  Contest Selection
    1) Select the desired contest using the Contest drop-down list.
    2) Enter the Contest Exchange in the Exchange field;
       any error messages will be displayed in the status area.
       (please keep in mind that the IARU HST Competition mode might ignore
        some settings so as to behave like the original program.)

    Specific contest information is at very bottom of this document.

  Station
    Call - enter your contest call sign here.
    QSK - simulates the semi-duplex operation of the radio. Enable it if your
          physical radio supports QSK. If it doesn't, enable QSK anyway to see
          what you are missing.
    CW Speed - select the CW speed, in WPM (PARIS system) that matches your
               skills. The calling stations will call you at about the same speed.
               There are more speed controls under the settings menu.
    CW Pitch - pitch in Hz.
    RX Bandwidth - there are several ways to adjust this. See the key
                   assignments below.


  Band Conditions
     Alex Shovkoplyas, VE3NEA, made the sound as realistic as possible,
     and included a few effects based on the mathematical model of the
     ionospheric propagation. Also, some of the calling stations exhibit
     less than perfect operating skills, again to make the simulation more
     realistic. These effects can be turned on and off using the check boxes
     described below.

     QRM - interference form other running stations occurs from time to time.
     QRN - electrostatic interference.
     QSB - signal strength varies with time (Rayleigh fading channel).
     Flutter - some stations have "auroral" sound.
     LIDS - some stations call you when you are working another station,
            make mistakes when they send code, copy your messages incorrectly,
            and send RST other than 599. They might even ask for info over and
            over.

     Activity - band activity, determines how many stations on average
                reply to your CQ.

  The Run Button
    This starts and stops the competition or contest.
    Starting a Contest -
      To start the contest that is selected in the contest drop down,
      set the duration in the minutes box and use the run drop down
      to select the desired mode for the contest (single call or pile up).
      You may have to hit F1 (or Enter) to start sending CQ.

    Starting a Competition -
      To start a Competition, select either the WPX and HST competitions found
      in the run drop down. Many settings are locked for the competitions but
      The keying speed and activity are still under your control.
      The default duration of a competition session is 60 minutes. You can
      change this setting to any time desired. To set a new default
      use the CompetitionDuration entry in the MorseRunner.ini file, e.g.:
        [Contest]
        CompetitionDuration=15

  Additional Settings
    RIT - Many never noticed that the original program has an RIT function
          in the receiver. It is the unmarked teal bar at the very bottom of
          the screen. If you can't hear someone calling you, or if they are off
          frequency this is why. This is controlled by the up and down arrows on
          the keyboard as well as the mouse scroll wheel. This is handy to
          focus on a particular responder.
          The RIT is adjusted between -500 and 500 Hz incremented in 50Hz Steps.
          You can modify the RIT step increment in the MorseRunner.ini file, e.g.:
            [Settings]
            RitStepIncr=50
          Valid values range between -500 and 500. Negative values can be used to
          change the direction of Up/Down arrow keys or mouse wheel movement. Note
          that a zero value will disable this feature and is not recommended.
          HST Competition mode ignores this setting and defaults to 50Hz/Step.

    Audio Recording Enabled - You can record yourself under "File" menu
      "Audio Recording Enabled". When this menu option is checked, MR saves
      the audio as "MorseRunner.wav" in the same folder. If this file already
      exists, MR overwrites it.

    Audio buffer size
      You can adjust the audio buffer size by changing the BufSize value in the
      MorseRunner.ini file. Acceptable values are 1 through 5, the default is 3.
      Increase the buffer size for smooth audio without clicks and interruptions;
      decrease the size for faster response to keyboard commands.

    Calls from a keyer
      If you have an electronic keyer that simulates a keyboard - that is, sends
      all transmitted characters to the PC as if they were entered from a keyboard,
      you can add the following to the INI file:
        [Station]
        CallsFromKeyer=1
      With this option enabled, the call sign entered into the CALL field is not
      transmitted by the computer when the corresponding key is pressed. This option
      has no effect in the WPX and HST competition modes.

    CW speed controls
      CW Min and Max settings
        Under the Settings menu the CW Min Rx Speed and CW Max RX Speed can
        establish a variable amount of speeds to respond to. Setting this to
        0 will have the program behave like the original MorseRunner 1.68.
      Farnsworth: For the K1USN SST contest only. Character wpm speed can be
        set by changing the number for "FarnsworthCharacterRate=25" entry in the
        MorseRunner.ini file found in the install folder and restarting the program.
      CW Speed increment
        This is changed in 2 WPM increments except the HST Competition which is locked
        at 5 WPM increments. The default WPM Step rate can be changed with values
        between 1 and 20 with the WpmStepRate entry in the MorseRunner.ini file, e.g.:
          [Station]
          WpmStepRate=2
      Suggestions
        Try selecting a speed higher than your proficiency to improve. Keep in mind
        the CWops CW Academy (free classes) start with 18 WPM, 20 WPM and 25 WPM
        character speeds for each level of classes.

    NR Digits
      The number of digits the responding station will send.
        There are four possible settings:
          1 - generates random serial numbers starting near 1 and increasing as
              the contest runs. Matches default behavior found in version 1.68.
          2 - 2 digits are sent, randomly generated between 1 and 99.
          3 - 3 digits are sent, randomly generated between 1 and 999.
          4 - 4 digits are sent, randomly generated between 1 and 9999.

  Responses
    There are five basic responses that you can receive:
       1. nothing
          If calling CQ, no one heard you call CQ again.
          If you responded to someone and you got silence, the call sent was incorrect.
          Send F8 NIL (Not In Log) to have them respond again and/or restart the pile-up.
       2. Corrected Call
          If you sent a partial call or if you were off a little they may respond with
          "de" (from) and their call or just their call again. Sometimes just the call
          is repeated and sometimes with the exchange.
       3. They may respond with "NR?"
          You will have to send your exchange again (Hit F2).
       4. They may respond with "AGN"
          You will have to send your exchange again (Hit F2).
       5. "R" with their exchange.
          When you get the exchange hit enter to log it.
          Please note that occasionally you will get "NR?" and "AGN" multiple times. Respond with
          F2 until you get that "R" (Roger) and the exchange.

    K1USN Slow Speed Test (SST)
    Members of the K1USN Radio Club, who are also members of the CW Operators’ Club (CWops),
    sponsor a one-hour slow speed CW “contest” called the SST. For those who prefer a more
    leisurely CW pace or are new CW operators or contesters, this just might be what you're looking for!
    When: Fridays 20:00-21:00 UTC & Mondays 00:00-01:00 UTC
    How: Slower speeds (up to 20 Words Per Minute). Usually sent with 25wpm character speeds.
    Many operators prefer slower effective speeds using the “Farnsworth” sending method,
    sending characters at speeds up to 25WPM.
    Farnsworth: For this contest only. Character wpm speed can be set by changing the number
    for "FarnsworthCharacterRate=25" entry in the MorseRunner.ini file found in the install
    folder and restarting the program.  Actual WPM throughput is set by entering a value
    in the CW Speed box.
    Exchange: suggested first name and state, province, or DX country. It is fairly common
    to send greetings before the exchange.
    Rules, frequencies and sample exchanges can be found at http://www.k1usn.com/sst.html
