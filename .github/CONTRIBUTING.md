If you wish to fix a bug, add a new feature or contest, provide documentation, develop training materials, or help in any way, these steps will get you started.

> The [atom editor project](https://www.github.com/atom/atom/) has provided some [good content](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Their material applies to our project as well and has inspired much of our content.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Morse Runner.

#### Before submitting a bug report
Before submitting bug reports, please consider the following as you may find you don't need to create one.

- Check for [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aw7sst%2FMorseRunner) to see if the problem has already been reported.
- If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to the issue you are reporting, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
- **If you are available to help test** an existing issue, please indicate by adding a comment to the issue.

#### How to submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
When you create a bug report, please include as many details as possible.
Please provide the following information by filling out the [bug report template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem.
- Describe what Morse Runner mode you were running.
- Describe the behavior you observed.
- Explain the behavior you expected to see and why.
- Include screenshots if appropriate.

Provide more context by answering these questions:
- Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating a new version) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem is recent, can you reproduce it in an older version? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions from the [releases page **TBD**]().
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details on about how often the problem happens or the conditions under which it happens.

Include details about your environment:
- Which version of Morse Runner are you using? You can get the version number from the Morse Runner About Box or the splash screen after program startup.
- What OS and version are you running?

Can you help?
- Are able to help the developer by answering questions or being available to test the solution once available?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through an enhancement suggestion to Morse Runner, including complete new features or minor improvements to existing functionality.
Keep in mind the MR team has limited resources so it's unlikely that we'll work on every request.
We will however label these requests with the `help wanted` tag so other community members will see them.
If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to discuss it in more detail.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
Before creating enhancement suggestions, please consider the following as you may find you don't need to create one.

- [Perform a search](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aw7sst%2FMorseRunner) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. Look for issues marked with the `enhancement` label.
- **If it has**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **If you are available to help test** an existing issue, please indicate by adding a comment to the issue.

#### How do I submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Please provide the following information by filling in the [feature request template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md).

Explain the feature request and describe why you think this feature is needed.
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see and why.
- Include screenshots if appropriate.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Morse Runner users.

### Suggesting New Contests

This section guides you through adding a contest request to Morse Runner.
We will add the `contest` label to each request; community members can volunteer to implement or help test each new contest. We have limited resources so it's possible that every request will not be implemented.

- Submitting a contest is similar to submitting a feature request.

#### Before Submitting A Contest Request
Before submitting a new contest, please search [contest requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aw7sst%2FMorseRunner+label%3Acontest)
to see if this contest has already been requested.
- **If it has**, please add a comment indicating your support for this contest. Contest requests are sorted by comment count. We use comment count as a proxy vote for each contest.
- **If you are available to help testing**, please add a comment to the request.

#### How do I submit a (good) contest recommendation?
Contest support suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Please provide the following information by filling in the [contest request template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/contest-request.md).

- Explain the contest request and describe why you think this contest is needed.
- Use a clear and descriptive title (e.g. Add Support for ARRL FD).
- Provide a link to the contest rules.
- Explain any special contest exchange behaviors that should be considered when adding this contest.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure of where to begin with Morse Runner? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:
- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3Aw7sst%2FMorseRunner+label%3A"good+first+issue"+label%3A"help+wanted"+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues that will only require a few lines of code or perhaps some documentation changes.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3Aw7sst%2FMorseRunner+label%3A"help+wanted"+-label%3A"good+first+issue"+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues that are a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by number of comments. Number of comments serves as a proxy for the impact a given change will make.

**To make changes to the code:**

1. **Select an issue** you would like to work on.
There is a [good first issue](#issue-attributes) label for issues that should be
ideal for people who are new to the MorseRunner project and code base.

1. **Change the [issue state](#issue-state) to "active"** to indicate you are
actively working on this issue.
 
1. **[Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and
clone it locally.**
Connect your local to the original "upstream" repository
by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay
up to date so when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
(For more detailed instructions, see [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).)

1. **Open a pull request** to track the work associated with the issue you have selected. See [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) below for more information.
Reference the issue # on which you are working.

1. **[Create a branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for your changes.**
Please follow the additional [developer guidelines](#developer-guidelines) below.

1. **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities.
This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would
in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge,
and for others to understand and maintain in the future.
See [developer guidelines](#developer-guidelines) below for more information.

1. [future] [Develop unit tests](#general-guidelines) to exercise the new
functionality. Some low-level code can be tested at the unit-test level.

1. **Add a [changelog entry](#label-changelog)** and update [Readme.txt](Readme.txt) as appropriate.

### Pull Requests
A pull request is used to track work being done within the project.
When you start working on a specific issue, create a pull request and
indicate which issue you are working on.
Keep the PR update-to-date during your development to notify others of
your progress.
If a larger change, you can push your branch so others can have an early-look
at your changes.
When your work is complete, the PR will be submitted for review by one or
more of the reviewers.

1. **Reference any relevant issues** or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, "Closes #13."). Usually a PR has an associated Issue #.

1. **Include screen shots of the before and after** if your change involves changes to the UI.
Drag/drop the changes into your pull request.

1. **Test your changes!** Please test your changes to best extent possible as there is no formal
test plan or test suite for this project. Consider asking the issue's author if they are available
for early testing. If so, push your branch and let them test it.

1. **Send the completed pull request** when your work is complete.
This notifies the maintainer of your pending contribution who will in turn merge
and publish your changes.
This may be an iterative process if others have found issues or have recommendations for
additional changes.
   - [ ] TODO - verify that this is how the process actually works.

#### Step by Step Pull Request Process
This process presumes you have created a branch with your changes.
Your branch should be rooted of our `main` branch.
1. To create a pull request start at the root of our repository.
2. click `branches` (next to the `# branches`).
3. Find your active branch and click `New pull request` (on the right).
4. Now modify the comparison and repository settings. This is tricky, so get this right...
Change the base repository from `VE3NEA/MorseRunner` to `w7sst/MorseRunner`.
5. Change the other fields to your branch name. If successful you should see `Able to Merge`.
6. You can update your comment.
7. Click `Create pull request`.
8. On the left, add a reviewer.

## Developer Guidelines
As contributors, we should adopt reasonable open source
development processes and conventions.
As a starting point, we can draw from www.opensource.guide.
These guidelines are recommendations, not rules. Please use your own judgment.

- [ ] TODO - identify other sources/examples of community development guidelines
and best practices for open source projects.
- [ ] TODO - pull in examples and table of contents from atom project (see below)

### General Guidelines
1. **Use feature branches.** Each enhancement should be developed on a separate feature branch.
Each branch can independently reviewed and tested before integration into main branch.
The idea is to keep each feature small and independent.
This is a common open source approach with multiple contributors and allows easy
code review and integration by other community members and maintainers.

1. **Open new issues.** whenever new unrelated problems or bugs are found during development.
Avoid going beyond the scope of the current problem when working on an issue.

1. **Unit Testing.** [future] When and where appropriate, develop [unit tests](#unit-testing)
to fully test low-level modules and if possible, show that a feature or behavior is
working as expected.
An example would be exercising the function that looks for a partial match of a
user-entered string against a given callsign.
   - [ ] TODO - develop unit test capability within Morse Runner.

1. **Code reviews** by other developers, project maintainers, and/or community members
should be performed on the feature branch as part of submitting the pull request.
Doing so will help maintain a solid code base.
Reviews also serve as a good way to learn details of the project.
Reviewers are looking for bugs and adherence to coding standards.
Additional code changes are often made after a review to incorporate suggested
improvement and/or suggestions.
Some reviewers may even contribute specific code changes as part of the review.
Code reviews will typically occur near the end of development or after
submitting your PR (Pull Request) for review.
   - [ ] TODO - We need to define how/when the code review occurs.
Github has tools to facilitate code reviews.
We need to find and adopt these tools and perhaps setup a automated processes if possible.

1. **Code refactoring** is encouraged and should always be performed independent of
feature development or bug fixing.
If working on a feature and you discover a refactoring opportunity,
please do this refactoring using a separate feature branch before completing
work on the current feature.

1. **Avoid reformatting of existing code** (e.g. changing indentation, if/then/else alignment, etc.).
Doing so make it really hard to merge and compare code.
    a. When modifying existing code, following the coding style of the original author.
    a. When writing a new module/unit, following recommended coding guidelines.
    a. Short term, we may remove code reformatting to make it easier to compare/merge code as needed.
    a. Long term, after most branches have been merged, we can consider code reformatting.

1. **Design Changes.** Please discuss any design changes with the project maintainers
before making these changes. If a pull request arrives without a prior discussion
regarding design or direction changes, the request will probably be denied.
We are open to design proposals and changes, but we do request that such changes
are discussed early. Please open an Issue do we can let the design discussion occur
and allow the design idea/proposal to evolve into something that we can agree to.

## Styleguides

### Changelog entries
- [ ] TODO - define how/where changelog entries are managed.
   a. If fixing a bug, mention the fix in the changelog file. TODO - what file?
   a. If adding a new feature, mention the enhancement in the changelog file.
   a. If appropriate, summarize the feature in Readme.txt.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to track and manage issues and pull requests.

GitHub search make it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests
you're interested in.
For example, you might be interested in beginner issues or perhaps open pull requests which
haven't been reviewed. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed
with a search link for finding open items with that label.
See [other search filters](TODO) which will help you write more focused queries.

We will grow these labels over time as we better understand this process and how to use them.
Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.
